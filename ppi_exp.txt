•	Three types of partition are supported by Teradata RDBMS:
•	Simple Partition
•	Case based Partition
•	Range based Partition

Creating a simple Partition

Create table Employee_table_PPI 
(
 Employee_No INTEGER,
 Dept_No         INTEGER,
 First_Name CHAR(30),
 Last_Name CHAR(30),
 Salary         DECIMAL(30,2)
)Primary Index(Employee_No)
  PARTITION BY (Dept_No);

Creating a Case Based Partition

CREATE      TABLE ORDER_Table 
(
ORD_number  integer NOT NULL,
customer_number integer NOT NULL,
order_date  date ,
order_total integer
)
PRIMARY INDEX (customer_number)
PARTITION BY CASE_N
     (Order_Total < 1000,
     Order_Total < 5000,
     Order_Total < 10000,
     Order_Total < 20000,
     NO Case, UNKNOWN);
) ;



Creating a Range Based Partition

CREATE TABLE ORDER_Table 
(
ORD_number  integer NOT NULL,
customer_number integer NOT NULL,
order_date  date ,
order_total integer
)
PRIMARY INDEX (customer_number)
PARTITION BY range_n (
            Order_date BETWEEN date '2010-01-01'       AND      date '2010-12-31'
            EACH interval '1' month,
NO RANGE 
        OR  UNKNOWN);

Multi Level Partitioning

CREATE TABLE ORDER_Table_MLPPI 
(
ORD_number  integer NOT NULL,
customer_number integer NOT NULL,
order_date  date ,
order_total integer
)
PRIMARY INDEX (customer_number)
PARTITION BY( range_n (
            Order_date BETWEEN date '2010-01-01'       AND      date '2010-12-31'
            EACH interval '1' DAY,);
PARTITION BY CASE_N
     (Order_Total < 1000,
     Order_Total < 5000,
     Order_Total < 10000,
     Order_Total < 20000,
     NO Case);
) ;
This type of partitioning is called a MULTI-LEVEL PPI. 
It is a Partition within a Partition. 
The top partition is the only one you can ALTER. 
With Multi-Level partitioning you can combine up to 15 Case_N or Range_N  partitions within partitions.
 NO Simple Partitioning can be used in Multi-Level Partitioning.
Why NUPI Created with partitioning?
This is because the PRIMARY INDEX (Order_Number ) was not part of the Partition. That is why most PPI tables are defined as NUPI
