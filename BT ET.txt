1) In systemfe I created a table named locktest.  From BTEQ, we will place a lock on this table.
	bt;
	lock systemfe.locktest for write;

2) In a different BTEQ session, we will try to select from this table, but we will be blocked.
	sel * from systemfe.locktest;

3) From lokdisp or pmon you will see that the session is blocked.
	Number of Blocked Trans displayed :      1
	=========================================
	Blocked Trans : 16383 02524608

           lock mode       : Write

           lock objectType : Row
           lock objectID   : DBID     : 000003EB
                           : DBNAME   : SYSTEMFE      
                           : TableID  : 00002EF6,0400
                           : TableName  : LOCKTEST      
                           : RowHashS : 2EF60000
                                        DUMMY TABLE LOCK

4) Run dumplocklog at this point, and you will see no rows are logged.

5) Go to the first BTEQ window and submit an end transaction statement.
	et;

6) Switch to the second BTEQ window and you will see the transaction completed (i.e. the lock request was granted).
	sel * from drew.locktest;

	 *** Query completed. No rows found. 
	 *** Total elapsed time was 15 minutes and 35 seconds.

7) Run dumplocklog again, and you will find a row for this blocking
